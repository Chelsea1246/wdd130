        <p>Hello! My name is Chelsea Opoku from Accra, Ghana. I love God and enjoy every little adventure life brings. I am currently studying Software Development at BYU, and when I am not studying, I love traveling, trying new cuisines, spending time at the beach, watching movies, and cuddling adorable babies and puppies. I believe in spreading joy, kindness, and a big smile wherever I go.</p>
