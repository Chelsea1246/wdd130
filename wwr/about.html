      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>White Water Rafting Adventures began with a small group of river enthusiasts who dreamed of sharing their
        passion for adventure and nature.
        Since our first trip, we’ve grown into a trusted name for safe, thrilling, and joyful rafting experiences
        across beautiful rivers.
        What started as a simple love for the water has become a lifelong mission to inspire others to explore,
        connect,and challenge themselves in the great outdoors.
        Our dedicated guides and staff bring years of experience, ensuring every guest feels confident, cared for,
        and ready for adventure.
        From gentle family floats to heart-pounding rapids, we offer experiences that celebrate the beauty of nature
        and the excitement of teamwork.
        At White Water Rafting Adventures, every splash, smile, and shared moment reminds us why we started — to
        make every journey on the river truly unforgettable.</p>
